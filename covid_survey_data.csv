I struggled between still having to keep up with my homework and still attending a 100-person lecture while being aware of the situation with COVID and knowing I had to pack.

While I certainly sympathize with the incredibly tough situation Harvard faced either way, I think it was a poor decision to send people home with so little notice and with no real choice in the matter. It set off massive parties and get-togethers across campus, where if anyone was infected corona it would have/did spread like wildfire. Then, everyone got on planes and trains to go home, potentially exposing tons of people that are in far more at-risk demographics. We obviously don't know all of the behind-the-scenes calculations that led to Harvard's decision, but that's my opinion based on the information available.

In my mind, the worst aspect of Harvard's response is how sudden it was. They should have told us at least a week beforehand that this option is on the table, and to at least begin considering move-out logistics. I'm sure they feared it would spark panic, but their decision made people panic with no ability to pre-plan, and forced them to buy expensive travel and storage options to deal with it. In a similar vein re communication, contradictory information coming from the university made things particularly hard. From my international friends I heard they got two emails in 10 minutes telling them they DID NOT, and then DID, have to move out by Sunday. I know they were struggling with a very compressed timeline, but they did not do a particularly good job of anticipating student needs and questions. The most glaring example is Commencement, where it took them 3-4 days to acknowledge that this is something that is ""on students' minds,"" as I think Mike Burke put it. It would have been so much better, and somewhat quieted the rumor mill, if they were just transparent about what stage they were at in the planning process, from the move-out decision onward. Just say, ""we can't make commitments to an alternative commencement plan at this point with the rapidly changing coronavirus situation, but we understand it's hugely important to seniors and we're committed to celebrating you when it's safe."" That's all it would take to reassure people, but we didn't get that from Bacow until a week and a half later. That, I think, was the biggest problem: being transparent about what they didn't, or couldn't, know.",4,,3-6 months,,2020,Female,White,,Winthrop,English

However, I am most disappointed—but not surprised—at the administration’s handling of the decision to send students home. There was no warning that this action was being considered, which would have given students time to prepare and consider possible options in a less stressful manner should the university ultimately decide to send us home. Furthermore, the email sent by President Bacow did not in fact say that students were to move out by Sunday the 15th at 5pm, but rather that those who would be leaving campus for spring break were simply asked not to return. The move-out information—which again, was completely different than that provided by the President of the university—was sent by Dean Khurana in a “follow-up”, which tends to imply clarification rather than the conveyance of an entirely different message. Moreover, students and faculty were told at the same time of this decision, putting a lot of stress on faculty to suddenly completely rewrite syllabi and figure out how to handle the rest of the semester, despite hints during some faculty meetings that Zoom may need to be used in the future. Students and parents were then directed to an FAQ’s page with all the Q’s and no answers, causing absolute chaos in terms of financial aid, safety, logistical, and other important information. Students were also told to talk to their House deans if they had any questions not answered on the FAQ’s page (of which there were many), but because House staff also did not have any details as to what was happening, speaking to these administrators was utterly useless and largely frustrating. While I understand that this decision may have been best for the larger community and was constantly evolving, better planning before its implementation would have been prudent. The way this decision was implemented, with crucial administrators, faculty, and staff equally as in the dark as the blindsided students, made the entire move-out process incredibly complicated, frustrating, and stressful. Classes really should have been canceled university-wide to allow students sufficient time to get their affairs in order before the ridiculously soon move-out date, especially since parents and other third parties with jobs and obligations were also implicated in this and most students couldn’t focus on schoolwork after receiving the news anyway. I am extremely disappointed in the lack of communication and incredibly poor planning and execution of this response.

I also find the UC's actions regarding advocating for grading policy changes disagreeable. To begin with, their survey only consisted of possible grading changes, leaving no room for students such as myself to vote for the status quo. This makes their survey results highly flawed. Moreover, from the creation of the survey to the setting up of an emergency meeting, it seems like the UC is inexplicably overzealous about pushing for specific changes (i.e. to universal models), and it is hard to trust that they are acting on behalf of the student population without more transparency and sound methodology. In particular, statements such as ""Ultimately, we believe that only a universal policy can be truly equitable, whether that be double A or universal pass"" (in one of their recent emails) seems to reflect an inappropriate amount of vested interest on their part in this matter, and are not expected from an organization who professes to aspire to be representative of the student population. This makes me wonder if the UC is keen on bringing about grading policy changes for their own benefit, and are just using their positions and relations with the general student population as a convenient means of pushing for these changes. For these reasons alone, I hope that their plans are not taken seriously until the student body can be convinced that this is truly in accordance with our wishes, and not something we are being coaxed into supporting.",9,"My country has been fairly effective in coping with the situation and boasts many features, such as availability of tests, good healthcare and contact tracing, which are among the best in the world.",3-6 months,,2023,Male,Asian,Thayer,,Mathematics

",2,"Donald Trump is absolutely incompetent. He was calling covid-19 a hoax up until a few weeks ago, yet is claiming now that he knew it was a pandemic before it was being called one. The lack of unified response by our government is horrifying- the fact that some states have not issued ""stay at home"" orders is awful and is putting people's lives at risk. This should not be a partisan issue. This is a public health crisis and the fact that some politicians are using this as an opportunity to spew xenophobia, partake in insider trading, and laugh in the face of science is abominable. If the federal government (Trump, Pelosi, Schumer, and the CDC) had come forward early on and all given the same information and advice, more people would be listening. Also, the fact that we don't have tests widely available is embarrassing given that we refused to use the WHO test.

If there's any silver lining, I think that it's that this pandemic is exposing all the cracks and faults in many government programs and systems (i.e. healthcare and childcare). It has also proved that having internet access is not a luxury, but a utility in order to participate in the modern world. Hopefully, moving forward, lawmakers and voters keep these things in mind when talking about policy and the people in the United States. I also hope that this will expose incompetent leadership at both the state and federal level, and will also spotlight the people who have stepped up and made their community's wellbeing their priority.

Moreover, the government really has exposed more scandal, lying, misinformation, and the futility of of the system that can so easily dish out money to businesses and large corporations but claims its citizens don't need the money. The US was never that ""great"", so there's no use trying to make it something it was never - especially those on the margins of society via race, gender, sexuality, immigrant status, disability status, and socioeconomic status. Harvard is also not perfect and frequently contributes to and propagates these issues in other ways on campus, but overall I am happy (to some degree) with Harvard's willingness to change and with Harvard's response to the pandemic.

The orders to leave campus in five days came out of nowhere and were very badly handled at the administrative level (though not at the House/tutor/advisor level, it should be noted). In particular, the key information in Khurana's email was hidden halfway through, and sent everyone into a panic.

Additionally, for all of Harvard's contingency planning, they've thrown many students who rely on them for healthcare into limbo. For students like me on the Student Health Insurance Plan, there is a huge problem with continuity of care that seems to have been completely neglected. I have had several fairly serious illnesses this semester (pneumonia, followed by opportunistic infections), and although when I left campus, I was mostly out of danger, I was promised follow-ups/tele-medicine from HUHS. Since I've been home, I've had yet another infection and a severe allergic reaction, for which I sought treatment at an urgent care clinic in my home state (I have no providers outside HUHS). I contacted my doctors at HUHS simply for a second opinion, and was told to find help locally. Given the current pandemic, many doctors' offices are not taking any new patients and many clinics are closed entirely. ",2,,6-12 months,,2020,Female,White,N/A,Eliot,Slavic Languages and Literatures
